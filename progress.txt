🏠 Kitchen-Tracker Progress Summary
✅ What We've Built - Solid Foundation
Backend Infrastructure

AWS Serverless Stack - Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB (working & deployed)
Repository Pattern - Clean data access layer with proper abstractions
Domain Models - Well-designed entities for tracking system
API Security Ready - API key infrastructure (temporarily disabled for development)

Core Domain Models

TrackableItem & CompletionRecord - Universal tracking system
Person - Household members with individual tracking ("Sarah" vs "John")
Pet & PetCareItem & PetCareRecord - Complete pet care system
Meal - Home Chef meal models (ready for API implementation)

Working APIs (All Tested)

Health API 📊

Create/get health trackable items
Mark items complete with timestamps
Get today's completions


Pet API 🐕🐱

Setup pets (dogs get heartworm + bath, cats don't)
Track feeding, treats, medications, baths
Notes support ("second treat - overweight pet")
Daily completion tracking


Person API 👥

Create household members
Person-specific health items ("Sarah's Morning Bupropion")
Data isolation (Sarah's items ≠ John's items)



Test Coverage 🧪

test_trackable_item_api.py - Health tracking (8 tests)
test_pet_api.py - Pet care system (8 tests)
test_person_api.py - Person & individual tracking (10 tests)
All passing - Solid foundation with regression protection

🎯 Key User Stories Addressed

✅ "My morning bupropion" - Individual medication tracking
✅ "Overweight pet tracking" - Notes on treat completions
✅ "Partner lying about feeding pets" - Shared pet care visibility
✅ "Spotty memory" - Simple completion tracking system


🚧 What's Left To Do
Backend APIs (Next Priority)

Meal API - Home Chef tracking, recipe links, cooking status
Household Tasks API - Shared chores, weekly/monthly routines
Weather Integration - External API for forecasts
Guest Services API - Room info, house details, local info

Frontend Development

Vue.js Tablet Interface - Touch-friendly dashboard
Today's View - What needs to be done today
Person-Specific Dashboards - Sarah's view vs John's view
Pet Care Quick Actions - Big buttons for feeding/treats
Meal Planning Interface - Home Chef meal display

Advanced Features

Home Chef Automation - Email parsing or web scraping
API Security - Re-enable API keys + IP restrictions
Weather Dashboard - Travel conditions + forecasts
Guest Experience - Personalized welcome screens

Remaining User Stories

Shared household chore tracking
Weather/travel information display
Guest room information system
Monthly pet medication reminders
Home Chef recipe accessibility in kitchen


🏆 What We've Achieved
Excellent Architecture:

Clean domain separation (Person ≠ Pet ≠ TrackableItem)
Proper repository pattern
Comprehensive test coverage
Scalable serverless infrastructure

Real Functionality:

Individual medication tracking working
Pet care system with overweight pet notes
Data isolation between household members
Daily completion tracking with timestamps

Development Best Practices:

Test-driven approach (after exploration phase)
Step-by-step development
Working deployments at each step
Clean code with proper abstractions
